                           pre-college science competition. Each year, approximately 1,800 high school students from more 80 countries, 
                           regions, and territories are awarded the opportunity to showcase their independent research and compete for
                            more than $5 million in prizes. Today, millions of students worldwide compete each year in local and school-sponsored 
                            science fairs; the winners of these events go on to participate in Society-affiliated regional and state fairs from 
                            which the best win the opportunity to attend Intel ISEF. Intel ISEF unites these top young scientific minds, showcasing
                             their talents on an international stage, where doctoral level scientists review and judge their work. </p>

                        <p>
                            Improvements in energy storage devices can help facilitate the implementation of renewable energy resources in collecting energy,
                             energy storage, and using the energy efficiently. Most energy storage devices today face similar problems: slow charging time,
                              low power and energy density, safety, and cost. The goal of this research was to address these issues with graphene supercapacitors.
                            Graphene supercapacitors have fast charging and discharging rates, which not only reduce charging time but also enable better performance.
                             The improvements in the electrolytes and the pattern design can further increase graphene supercapacitors’ power and energy density. 
                             Inexpensive graphene supercapacitors can lower the cost of energy storage in solar and wind farms. They also have many more applications 
                             on a smaller scale. Graphene’s flexibility and transparency give graphene supercapacitors many potential applications in electronic devices
                              like phones and wearables. Driving down the cost of LSG (laser scribed graphene) and scaling up the production will help make graphene
                               supercapacitors commercially available.
                  Although some lithium-ion batteries can achieve fast charging rates, graphene supercapacitors have many more benefits thanks to graphene’s physical properties. 
                  A gelled electrolyte allows more flexibility and does not have the safety hazard of leakage while a reliable solid electrolyte in batteries is yet to be invented. 
                  Despite the low-cost associated with sodium-based batteries, the comparative performance of graphene supercapacitors may still be superior.</p>
                  <p>
                      This research focused on scalable inexpensive graphene supercapacitors from graphite oxide exfoliated with LightScribe DVD burners. This research demonstrated 
                      the feasibility of an inexpensive scalable high energy density graphene supercapacitor. The graphene capacitor made with the LightScribe method has a capacitance 
                      of about 200  . It would take approximately four kilograms of those capacitors in parallel to have one Farad of capacitance. Although my graphene supercapacitors
                       did not achieve high energy density, they have the potential to with further improvements. The inexpensive and scalable method could be helpful for manufacturers as well.
